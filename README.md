Simple random trips generator

This project has an ambition to become a full-fat random trip generator.
Ultimately, it should not only generate random distance and azimuth but also represent the results on a map based on the input of starting coordinates.
I need to figure out how to connect it with Mapy.cz API, translate the generated numbers into the coordinates (or how to generate the coordinates within given parameters, which may be an easier way) and view it on the map.
